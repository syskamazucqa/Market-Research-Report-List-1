<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CSF Management Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CSF Shunts</li><li>CSF Drainage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CSF management market comprises two primary types: CSF shunts and CSF drainage systems. CSF shunts are devices implanted to redirect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the brain's ventricles to another body cavity, relieving pressure from conditions like hydrocephalus. CSF drainage systems, on the other hand, are designed for temporary removal of excess CSF, often used in acute clinical situations to manage conditions like infections or bleeding. Both types are crucial for treating neurological disorders and preventing complications.</p></p>
