<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Drainage System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical drainage system market includes two main types: passive drains and active drains. Passive drains rely on gravity and natural body processes for fluid removal, utilizing gravity or capillary action to facilitate drainage without external suction. In contrast, active drains employ suction mechanisms to create negative pressure, actively pulling fluids from the surgical site. Both types are essential for preventing infection, promoting healing, and managing fluid accumulation post-surgery, catering to diverse surgical needs and patient conditions.</p></p>
