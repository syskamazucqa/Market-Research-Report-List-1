<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Distributed Solar Inverter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-tied</li><li>Grid/Hybrid</li><li>Off-grid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The distributed solar inverter market consists of three primary types: grid-tied, grid/hybrid, and off-grid systems. Grid-tied inverters connect solar panels directly to the utility grid, allowing for energy exchange and net metering. Grid/hybrid inverters combine features of grid-tied and off-grid systems, enabling storage solutions and efficient energy management during outages. Off-grid inverters operate independently from the utility grid, powering loads directly from solar energy and battery storage, making them ideal for remote areas lacking grid access.</p></p>
