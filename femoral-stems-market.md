<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Femoral Stems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cementless</li><li>Cemented</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The femoral stems market is primarily categorized into two types: cementless and cemented stems. Cementless femoral stems rely on biological fixation, allowing bone in-growth for stability and longevity, making them suitable for younger, active patients. In contrast, cemented femoral stems utilize polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) to bond the implant to the bone, offering immediate stability and being commonly used in elderly patients or those with compromised bone quality. Both types cater to diverse patient needs and surgical preferences in hip replacement procedures.</p></p>
