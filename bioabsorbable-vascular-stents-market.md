<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bioabsorbable Vascular Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer-Based Bioabsorbable Stents</li><li>Metal-Based Bioabsorbable Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bioabsorbable vascular stents market comprises two main types: polymer-based and metal-based stents. Polymer-based bioabsorbable stents are made from biocompatible polymers that gradually dissolve in the body, promoting natural healing and reducing long-term complications. In contrast, metal-based bioabsorbable stents utilize materials like magnesium or iron, which also dissolve over time but provide initial structural support similar to traditional metal stents. Both types aim to enhance patient outcomes by minimizing the risk of restenosis and improving vascular function.</p></p>
